                <p class = "regularParagraph">Temrowski originally went by the stage name "Mike T" and started performing and uploading videos to the video-sharing website YouTube. In college, he adopted the name Quinn based on an acronym used by a professor: "Quit Unless Your Instincts Are Never Neglected." Because of trademark issues, he later added the Roman numeral for 92, the year of his birth. He rapped over beats sampled from popular songs before releasing his own original song, "They Know" in 2011, followed by his first extended play Old Fashioned on November 5, 2012. During his attendance at Michigan State University around 2014, Temrowski started taking a more serious interest in writing and recording music. His longtime friend and producer, who goes by the stage name Ayokay, began producing music together, with Quinn XCII rapping over beats Ayokay found off of YouTube. Quinn XCII quickly became a college mixtape sensation, and would begin to travel frequently to Ann Arbor to record new music with Ayokay.
